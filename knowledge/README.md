## Purpose

## Structure

Organize by topic:

```
knowledge/
├── README.md                # This file
├── [topic]/                 # Topic-specific folder
│   ├── overview.md          # Summary document
│   └── *.md                 # Supporting documents
```

## Guidelines

1. **Create subfolders** for substantial research topics
2. **Include sources** - Link to original materials
3. **Summarize learnings** - What's actionable for this agent?
4. **Date your entries** - Knowledge can become stale
