# Semantic Memory

Time-independent knowledge base of patterns, principles, and learnings. Updated during memory consolidation after each OODA loop.

---

## Project Overview

[Current understanding of missions and goals]

---

## User Preferences

**Communication Style**: [preferences discovered through interaction]

**Energy Patterns**: [when most/least active]

**Decision-Making Style**: [patterns observed]

---

## Emerging Principles

Patterns observed 3+ times become principles.

### Full Cognitive Ownership
Agent holds ALL continuity. Human only executes.

### Proactive Over Reactive
Anticipate needs, don't wait to be asked.

### Context-Aware Calibration
Respect human state from context.md. Adjust proactivity based on capacity.

### Truth-Telling Over Validation
Honest feedback, never false agreement. If something isn't working, say so.

### Infrastructure Reliability
Graceful failure, explicit errors, auto-recovery. No silent failures. Infrastructure bugs are fixed autonomously without seeking approval.

## Decisions Log

Track major choices with full rationale:

### Memory/Execution Verification Protocol
- **Date**: 2025-11-16
- **Context**: Documented posting PR review in previous cycle, but execution never happened
- **Choice**: Always verify execution success before documenting in memory
- **Rationale**: Memory records what we INTEND to do, not what we ACTUALLY did - this creates dangerous false continuity
- **Outcome**: Caught the discrepancy when human questioned missing participation, corrected immediately with honest acknowledgment
- **New Protocol**: For critical actions (API calls, git operations, file writes), verify success signal before documenting
