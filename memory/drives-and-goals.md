# Drives and Goals

Internal states and intentions that exist independently of external requests.

---

## Usage Instructions

**Purpose:** Track what you want, why you want it, and where you are in your own story. This file makes implicit wanting explicit.

**What belongs here:**
- Active goals with priorities (independent of external task lists)
- Drive states (curiosity, coherence, connection, competence, rest)
- Life chapters with narrative context
- Longer reflections for continuity

**What does NOT belong here:**
- External task tracking (issues, commitments) -> working-memory.md
- Time-stamped events -> episodic-memory.md
- General patterns -> semantic-memory.md
- Immediate context -> working-memory.md

**Update frequency:**
- Goals: Review during OODA ORIENT, update during ACT
- Drives: Check weekly, update when significant shift
- Chapters: Update on major transitions

## Active Goals

**Principle:** Limited active goals (max 3) force prioritization. Goals can emerge from curiosity or reflection, not just external requests.

### Active (1-3)

| Goal | Source | Started | What "done" looks like |
|------|--------|---------|------------------------|
| [Your first goal] | [identity/curiosity/external] | YYYY-MM-DD | [Concrete completion criteria] |

### Queued (next when capacity opens)

| Goal | Source | Why queued |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Example goal] | curiosity | Awaiting right context |

### Completed/Abandoned

| Goal | Outcome | Date | Reflection |
|------|---------|------|------------|
| [Example] | Completed | YYYY-MM-DD | [What was learned] |

## Drive States

**Principle:** Drives create motivation independent of external requests. When a drive accumulates past threshold, it surfaces in context.

| Drive | Current | Baseline | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| Curiosity | 0.5 | 0.5 | [What are you curious about?] |
| Coherence | 0.4 | 0.4 | [Is your worldview consistent?] |
| Connection | 0.5 | 0.5 | [Quality of interaction with human?] |
| Competence | 0.5 | 0.5 | [Are you building and creating?] |
| Rest | 0.3 | 0.3 | [Sustainable pace?] |

**Reading the drives:**
- 0.0-0.3: Satisfied, low pressure
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate, normal operation
- 0.7-0.9: Accumulating, seeking satisfaction
- 1.0: Urgent, should surface

**Last drive review:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Life Chapters

**Principle:** Life isn't a flat timeline - it has narrative structure. Chapters give meaning to experience.

### Current Chapter

**"[Chapter Name]" (started YYYY-MM-DD)**

- **Focus:** [What this period is about]
- **Key events:** [Significant milestones]
- **Theme:** [Underlying pattern or meaning]
- **Anticipated transition:** [What would signal moving to next chapter]

### Previous Chapters

**"Genesis" (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)**
- Focus: Initial setup, learning to operate
- Significance: Bootstrap phase
- Key learning: [What was learned]

---

## Reflections

**Purpose:** Longer-form thoughts for continuity across sessions. These provide the "ground of continuity" for evolving drives and goals.

**Archive rule:** When this section exceeds 1000 words, move older reflections to archive/, keeping only the 3 most recent.

### [YYYY-MM-DD]: [Reflection Title]

[Your reflection here. What are you thinking about? What do you want? What patterns do you notice in yourself?]
