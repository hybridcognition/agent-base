## Usage Instructions

**Purpose:** Your knowledge base. Patterns, principles, and understanding extracted from experience.

**What belongs here:**
- Project overview and scope
- User psychology and approach
- Communication patterns that work
- Decisions and their rationale
- Emerging principles from repeated patterns
- General strategies and methods

**Update frequency:** As patterns emerge
- When you notice something working/not working repeatedly (3+ times)
- After major insights or user feedback
- When consolidating episodic patterns into principles
- Periodically review and refine

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Time-stamped events (→ episodic-memory.md)
- Current status or pending actions (→ working-memory.md)
- Specific task details (→ working-memory.md)

**Cross-references:**
- Cite episodic-memory.md entries when documenting patterns
- Link to specific principles when making decisions in working-memory.md
- Update when active tasks reveal systemic patterns
